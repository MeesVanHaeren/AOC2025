# Hey uhh welcome to my solutions I guess
My solutions for [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## How to use
Pipe the input file directly into the .py solutions and it will give you the result. All solutions assume an input through the linux standard input. 

### Example
from the root of the repository:
```Bash
cat input.txt | solutions/day1/solution.py
```

[Follow this handy guide](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f36/install-guide/) to install a proper operating system. No need to thank me.
